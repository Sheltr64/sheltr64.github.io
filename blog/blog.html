    <h3>In other news...</h3>
    <p>Yesterday, there was a stabbing of <b>11</b> people at a <b>WALLMART</b> of all places. I'm not too sure how someone can stab even one person without anyone sounding alarm, but I wansn't in there so I can't really be the judge of what happened there.</p>
    <p>According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/27/us/walmart-stabbing-traverse-city-charges.html">New York Times</a>, he had a 3 inch folding knife, and started going to town. It scares me how much someone can get away with before people start to notice</p>
