    <h3>GIMP is pretty cool</h3>

    <h3>In other news...</h3>
    <p>Yesterday, there was a stabbing of <b>11</b> people at a <b>WALLMART</b> of all places. I'm not too sure how someone can stab even one person without anyone sounding alarm, but I wansn't in there so I can't really be the judge of what happened there.</p>
    <p>According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/27/us/walmart-stabbing-traverse-city-charges.html">New York Times</a>, he had a 3 inch folding knife, and started going to town. It scares me how much someone can get away with before people start to notice</p>

    <h3>I'm too dumb for this crap</h3>
    <p>Today was the deadline that my college would accept offical transcripts, me being the idiot I am, I thought that they needed to recieve it from the school itself. It turns out that I can just email them a pdf of the transcript that my school gave me. Not sure how that works, I thought that the whole point of an offical transript was that it couldn't be doctored but whatever :/</p>
