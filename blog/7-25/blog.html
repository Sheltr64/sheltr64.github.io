    <h3>GIMP is pretty cool</h3>
    <p>I (semi) learned how to use <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a></p>
    <p>Heres my first image</p><img src="/blog/7-25/images/leanbeefpatty.png" height="300px">
    <p>I think I have issues that are more than technical</p>
    <br>
    <h3>In other news...</h3>
    <p>Yesterday, there was a stabbing of <b>11</b> people at a <b>WALLMART</b> of all places. I'm not too sure how someone can stab even one person without anyone sounding alarm, but I wansn't in there so I can't really be the judge of what happened there.</p>
    <p>According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/27/us/walmart-stabbing-traverse-city-charges.html">New York Times</a>, he had a 3 inch folding knife, and started going to town. It scares me how much someone can get away with before people start to notice</p>

    <h3>I'm too dumb for this crap</h3>
    <p>Today was the deadline that my college would accept offical transcripts, me being the idiot I am, I thought that they needed to recieve it from the school itself. It turns out that I can just email them a pdf of the transcript that my school gave me. Not sure how that works, I thought that the whole point of an offical transript was that it couldn't be doctored but whatever :/</p>

    <h3>I tried (and failed) to get into Pierce the Veil</h3>
    <p>My friend is a huge emo-pop fan. He's been looking for someone to talk music with for quite some time</p>
    <p>I decided to pick up Pierce the Veils "Selfish Machines" (left) and "Collide With The Sky" (right)</p><img src="/blog/7-25/images/pierce-the-veil-selfish-machines-Cover-Art.jpg" width="200"><img src="/blog/7-25/images/pierce-the-veil-collide-with-the-sky-Cover-Art.jpg" width="200">
    <p>I won't deny that the quality of music was there, but nothing felt really that "special" I know this is a gross misrepresentation, but I swear I was listening to My Chemical Romance, a band I found to be a lot more interesting as a whole. I digress, the whole focus on the entry should be on the music. Which is great! I loved the over top preformances of Vic Fuentes and his extremely high vocal registers. Although after my 2 hour long marithon, it got to the point where the insrumentals started to all blend together.</p>
    <p>for me, the best songs are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Caraphernelia</li>
      <li>King For A Day</li>
      <li>Hell Above</li>
      <li>Besitos</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I got diagnosed with a huge case of the "Cool but its not for me's" which is a shame, because the same hyperdramatic lyrics that make my eyes roll now, would have been happily welcomed by 14 year old me. It definitely is a solid outfit that I do respect.</p>
    <h3>overall. 7/10</h3>

    <h3>I want to learn <a href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a></h3>
    <p>One problem is that using this stupid mouse really does kinda suck, I've used Krita to draw a little bit, but I really coudn't get the feel of it compared to traditional pen/pencil. Here is one of my drawings, it was orininally the favicon of this blog but I scrapped it (RIP).</p><img src="/blog/images/kritathing.jpg">
    <p>I definitely need to pick up a drawing tablet. One  pen tablet (no screen) that I've been looking in to getting is the <a href="https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/one-by-wacom">One</a> by Wacom, clocking in at around $40, I'm told that it strikes a good balance between quality and price, and preformance. Source: Reddit</p>
    <p>I estimate that when I pick up drawing I'll be making art at this caliber in around a week or two</p><img src="/blog/7-25/images/Mona_Lisa.jpg" height="300" alt="A picture of the Mona Lisa">

    <h3>I hate HP</h3>
    <p>I spent last night looking up how to install <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a> on my friends PC, should be easy right? Set up <a href="https://www.ventoy.net/">Ventoy</a>, drag and drop the ISO to the USB stick, boot into it and we're in the clear, right? <b>WRONG</b> apparently his PC had a <a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/intel-optane-memory-faq">Dell Optane</a>, Which for a TLDR is bascially this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Acts as controller for acting as a "Fake SSD" to make a normal spinning HDD speed up a little bit more (imagine a fast disk dedicated to being a page file)</li>
      <li>It was used by OEMs in the late 2010's because of the high prices of normal SSDs</li>
      <li>It quickly fell out of fasion when SSDs became cheaper</li>
      <li>All the drivers are completely proprietary</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That last part is the most important and because of it, Mint was having a hard time understanding what it was working with, abruptly ending my installation process, telling me to disable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID">RAID</a> which the PC doesn't have, so I asked my good friend ChatGPT, to save the day.</p>
    <p>Here's a little life lession from me, don't use a LLM to help you solve a problem that doesn't have a clear issue</p>
    <p>I went on this wild goose chase for several hours trying to diagnose my issue. Thinking the problem was RAID, I scoured the deepest depths of <i><b>shudder </b></i><span style="font-family: omori_spooky">REDDIT</span>; on there I went on this endless cycle of enabling and disabling security features on the PC. Safeboot, fastboot, virtualization support (I think I forgot to re-enable it on his PC, sorry), boot keys, and much much more. NOTHING.</p>
    <p>In the end, it was this page that tipped my off that something <b>could</b> have been a hardware issue <img src="/blog/7-25/images/disk config.jpg" height="600"></p>
    <p>The thing is, my USB stick was also a 16GB drive, so I assumed that the PC was simply picking up on that, not knowing that I just diagnosed the root cause. Yes I know it says NVME, but to play devils advocate here, I was simply being lazy.</p>
    <br>

    </div>
    <p>In the end, I did end up opening up the PC, but I was amazed to what I saw: a CD drive. This came as a massive suprise as I had been wanting a way to rip my old CDs for a long time now. Digging a little bit deeper into the PC (and removing all the proprietary screws) I got to the NVME slot, removed the horrible disease that plagued the desktop, and put everything back together.</p>
    <img src="/blog/7-25/images/Intel Optane.png">
    <p>Here is a picture of the drive</p>
    <h3>Was this worth is?</h3>
    <p>Hard <b>YES</b>. Not only did Mint essentially breathe new life into his system, but I also got to rip a few of my discs (shoutout Sufjan Stevens)</p>
    <p>Hopefully I can play more games with him without having his PC die in every game we try something new</p>
