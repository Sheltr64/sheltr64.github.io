    <h2>Undertale is a classic</h2>
    <p>Recently, I've been playing a bit of Undertale. I don't think the game needs much introduction at this point but for those uninitiated: Undertale is an action adventure RPG with bullet hell mechanics, it blends both heartfelt writing with whitty and slapstick humor. </p>
    <p>I could tell that the writer had took a page from Valve's book when it came to its humor. Portal 2 and Undertale share the same DNA in their delivery in dialoge.</p>
    <p>If you enjoy shorter story games with a strong soundtrack, and good worldbuilding, consider picking it up on sale.</p>
    <p>I haven't completed the game yet but what I've played so far in my 5 hours have been very strong.</p>
