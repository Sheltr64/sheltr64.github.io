    <h3>Midterms are finally over!</h3>
    <p>I'm around halfway done with my first semester. I've had tonnes of fun so far. (almost) Every day has been productive here. One of my biggest fears was falling back into my bad habits of playing too much video games or forgetting important things</p>
    <p>Thats where Todoist and Proton Calendar come into play. Todoist is a note taking app unlike anything I've used before (I haven't used any note taking apps before). When I was in 6th grade, my teacher made everyone use a planner, and safe to say I hated it. It was big and bulky, not really worth the bag real estate for me, so it collected dust.</p>
    <p>Todoist has the advantage of being on my phone, something I can't keep my hands off anyways, so its always getting some degree of use. Proton Calendar has been a lifeline for helping me prep out my week, and reminding me to actually get my sorry butt off the internet and lock in for an hour or two.</p>

    <p>I'm really happy as to how things are going right now</p>
    <h2>10/20/25</h2>
    <h3>Canvas is dead :(</h3>
    <p>Today I woke up to finish some homework due in at 10AM. I did the usual, I got up around 7 (miserable and groggy), got off my bed (after laying in bed for half an hour), and I ate breakfast (it was junk food). When I got back to my dorm to wrap up my work. I was met with the worst thing I could imagine.</p>
    <h3>CANVAS IS DOWN</h3>
    <p>"Thank God I don't have multiple due assignments due and a quiz that I have to take today who's study guide is on Canvas I said to myself"</p>
    <p>Just kidding I absolutely bombed that quiz, couldn't turn in my homework. can't log in to do my other assignments that are due tomorrow. Safe to say I'm screwed</p>
    <h3>On the bright side...</h3>
    <p>I got to use a Bloomberg Terminal! For the uninitiated, a Bloomberg Terminal is the gold standard for stock analysists over on Wall St. It has a ton of cool tools for mass sorting and fast access statisics like options premiums and EV/EBITDA multiples. Since I'm not a buisness major, I can't use it on my own, I need a friend who is one to access it.</p>
    <p>I also got a Framework 12 Laptop! It's a very well built piece of hardware. While it only has a 13th gen i5, it is more than capable of heavy duty web browsing. I can open as many Chrome tabs as I want unlike that other POS laptop with 8 gigs of ram.</p>
    <p>Here is the fastfetch</p><div class="collage"><img src="/blog/10-25/images/fastfetch.png"></div>
    <p>32 gigs of ram is no joke. I payed a hefty price tag for it, I think my reciept was over 800 bones. Thats almost 2 Switch 2s. I'll probably make a full blog entry about it some time.</p>
