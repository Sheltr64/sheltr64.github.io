    <h3>Midterms are finally over!</h3>
    <p>I'm around halfway done with my first semester. I've had tonnes of fun so far. (almost) Every day has been productive here. One of my biggest fears was falling back into my bad habits of playing too much video games or forgetting important things</p>
    <p>Thats where Todoist and Proton Calendar come into play. Todoist is a note taking app unlike anything I've used before (I haven't used any note taking apps before). When I was in 6th grade, my teacher made everyone use a planner, and safe to say I hated it. It was big and bulky, not really worth the bag real estate for me, so it collected dust.</p>
    <p>Todoist has the advantage of being on my phone, something I can't keep my hands off anyways, so its always getting some degree of use. Proton Calendar has been a lifeline for helping me prep out my week, and reminding me to actually get my sorry butt off the internet and lock in for an hour or two.</p>

    <p>I'm really happy as to how things are going right now</p>
