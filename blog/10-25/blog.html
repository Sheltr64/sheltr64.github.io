    <h3>Midterms are finally over!</h3>
    <p>I'm around halfway done with my first semester. I've had tonnes of fun so far. (almost) Every day has been productive here. One of my biggest fears was falling back into my bad habits of playing too much video games or forgetting important things</p>
    <p>Thats where Todoist and Proton Calendar come into play. Todoist is a note taking app unlike anything I've used before (I haven't used any note taking apps before). When I was in 6th grade, my teacher made everyone use a planner, and safe to say I hated it. It was big and bulky, not really worth the bag real estate for me, so it collected dust.</p>
    <p>Todoist has the advantage of being on my phone, something I can't keep my hands off anyways, so its always getting some degree of use. Proton Calendar has been a lifeline for helping me prep out my week, and reminding me to actually get my sorry butt off the internet and lock in for an hour or two.</p>

    <p>I'm really happy as to how things are going right now</p>
    <h2>10/20/25</h2>
    <h3>Canvas is dead :(</h3>
    <p>Today I woke up to finish some homework due in at 10AM. I did the usual, I got up around 7 (miserable and groggy), got off my bed (after laying in bed for half an hour), and I ate breakfast (it was junk food). When I got back to my dorm to wrap up my work. I was met with the worst thing I could imagine.</p>
    <h3>CANVAS IS DOWN</h3>
    <p>"Thank God I don't have multiple due assignments due and a quiz that I have to take today who's study guide is on Canvas I said to myself"</p>
    <p>Just kidding I absolutely bombed that quiz, couldn't turn in my homework. can't log in to do my other assignments that are due tomorrow. Safe to say I'm screwed</p>
    <h3>On the bright side...</h3>
    <p>I got to use a Bloomberg Terminal! For the uninitiated, a Bloomberg Terminal is the gold standard for stock analysists over on Wall St. It has a ton of cool tools for mass sorting and fast access statisics like options premiums and EV/EBITDA multiples. Since I'm not a buisness major, I can't use it on my own, I need a friend who is one to access it.</p>
    <p>I also got a Framework 12 Laptop! It's a very well built piece of hardware. While it only has a 13th gen i5, it is more than capable of heavy duty web browsing. I can open as many Chrome tabs as I want unlike that other POS laptop with 8 gigs of ram.</p>
    <p>Here is the fastfetch</p><div class="collage"><img src="/blog/10-25/images/fastfetch.png"></div>
    <p>32 gigs of ram is no joke. I payed a hefty price tag for it, I think my reciept was over 800 bones. Thats almost 2 Switch 2s. I'll probably make a full blog entry about it some time.</p>
    <h2>10/30/25</h2>
    <h3>I have a little time so I'll just say this</h3>
    <p>The world hasn't stopped. You've just been looking at all the wrong places.</p>
    <p>I remember I was really depressed around 5 months ago, I had picked up this habit of waking up at 2pm-ish, playing video games with some friends who just got off work (and being a productive member of society), and when midnight came around, My day really started. I had this nightly ritual where I would sneak some beers from the fridge, and get really hammered. By the time I had downed my 6th beer, my priorites focused to getting any pent up emotion out as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p>Since I lived on a farm, privacy wasn't too much of an issue. I would gather my dogs and run around screaming my guts out. It was a degree of liberation that I don't think can be achieved by any other means. I love my dogs, each one of them are precious to me. I would always wrestle with the biggest dog. He's a good 80 pounds, and super energetic.</p>
    <p>I think the root cause of it was simply I felt like the world leaving me behind. I knew I was better than this. Ever since I was little there was this one person in my life who would always clip my wings or try to bring me down. I won't name drop anyone, but you know who you are.</p>
    <p>My life really has turned around for the better, I don't think I've been this consistently happy since I was 7, thats over a decade of depression. I've had ups and (many) downs, but I really do want change this time. I just really hope my hard work pays off this time. I hope that whoever is reading this at least hears me out. I don't ask for empathy for my mistakes, but I do ask for second chances. You only have one shot at life after all.</p>
    <p>Welp, thats about all I have to say for this month. I still do plan on doing a Framework entry at some point, I just have to find the time I guess. See you next month!</p>
    <small>oh and one last thing; to the person who dragged me down all these years.</small>
