    <h3>I got a drawing tablet</h3>
    <p>Last week I expressed my desire to start drawing, I have a cool e-ink drawing tablet that served me pretty well but to be honest, it didn't fit my needs all too well. Most of what I do is done via my PC, and laptop, with a very small selection of devices thrown into the mix. The main issue is that it became a hassle to pick up and use on the daily, and exporting files was a major pain. Of course I could have used a <a href="https://nextcloud.com">Nextcloud</a> instance, but I have neither the time nor money to get a NAS working.</p>
    <p>For me, the obvoius choice was doing all the work on my desktop, so I ordered <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wacom-Wireless-Software-Pistachio-CTL4100WLE0/dp/B079J7DCXN?s=electronics">This</a> tablet by Wacom.</p>
    <p>Now that I'm offically Windows free, and switched to Linux, I have taken an oath to make anything and everything I do take 10x the time and effort because "iT'S mUh FrEEdoMs".</p>
    <p>Because of that, roadblocks appear in front of me every step of the way. One such roadblock was drivers, you see Wacom doesn't have any offical drivers for Linux, so instead, the community had to step in. I checked Github for any alternatives and found the <a href="https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/OpenTabletDriver">OpenTabletDriver</a> program and I have to say -- I'm thoughoughly impressed by how smooth and seemless the experience was. Truth be told I was expecting a old, clunky GTK2 program, but what I was met with was an easy to understand GUI that was a little bit on the underpowered side, but with plugins you could probably get by just fine!</p>
    <p>Do note that Linux <b>DOES</b> come with generic drawing tablet support out of the box, but for some reason playing OSU on it was all buggy. I did use an unoffical flatpak release of it, (no im not using your dumb appimg idgaf if its easier to maintain) and using the tablet had this issue where my cursor would be stuck in a corner, unable to move. I of course solved this issue by switching to OpenTabletDriver</p>
    <h3>As it stands, here is my current setup, and a little doodle I did on Krita.</h3>

      <h3>WOW!</h3>
    </div>
    <h3>Now you may ask yourself -- What does that mean?</h3>
    <p>With the power of <a href="https://xfce.org/">XFCE</a>, and the newly released <a href="https://bits.debian.org/2025/08/trixie-released.html">Debian 13</a>, I made my laptop look straight out of the XP era!</p>
    <p>Debian is (in my opinion) one of the best distros you can get your hands on</p>
    <h3>Here is my objective tier list of all the distros</h3>
    <p><i>only the top 3 are worth using daily</i><br>(Debian, Linux Mint, and Fedora)</p>
    <img src="/blog/8-25/images/distro_tierlist.png" style="width: 15em; height: auto;">
    <p>I didn't do anything too crazy with my setup, only changing a minimal amount of things like the dock, switching from 24H to AM/PM, and menial stuff like that</p>
    <p>Here's a screenshot of both my laptop and a Windows XP desktop</p>

    <img src="/blog/8-25/images/ref.jpg" style="width: auto;  height: 10em;">
    <p>Pretty cool right? I know it's a little cheesy but honestly, that just adds to the charm of it.</p>
    <p>I might go more into depth with this thing tomorrow, right now, I've been writing, formating, and coding everything manually (with a little help from GPT for things like css) so this process takes hours to do.</p>
    <p>I have been thinking about switching to vim, I can imagine a nvim + lazyvim setup. It really does suck that NVChad doesn't support Debian.</p>

    <h3>Monero is under attack!</h3>
    <p>This may sound bag holderish, but Monero is one of the ONLY good crypto currencies out there -- the only other one being $TRUMP.</p>
    <p>I despise how people view crypto these days. What started off as a new idea where centralized banks went the way of the dodo, slowly became more and more similar to the large banking institutions we have today.</p>
    <p>The way I see it, people shouldn't have to bend the knee to whatever company they keep their assets in.</p>
    <p>To help illustrate my gripes, I'll give an example of what happens when centralized authorities control how your money is spent.</p>
    <p>Steam, a major online video game distributor, recently came under scrutiny reguarding the sale of the content on its storefront. The activist group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_Shout">Collective Shout</a>, started pressuring major payment processors (Visa, PayPal, Mastercard, etc.) to delist games that featured rape, child sexual abuse, and incest. Quite the noble cause right?</p>
    <p>Well, the payment processers thought so too -- demanding that Steam either delist the games or face the threat of a boycott from the companies. Obvoiously Steam condeded and took those games down.</p>
    <p>This sets a </i><span style="font-family: omori_spooky; font-size: 0.8em;">SPOOKY</span> and </i><span style="font-family: omori_spooky">SCARY</span> precedent over the power that these corporations have over your money. This isn't something to be ignored.</p>
    <h4>Imagine a world where becomes the norm</h4>
    <p>In this world, PayPal could stop my donation to a politcal campaign that they don't agree with; or Visa could prevent me from paying for my VPN's in an increasingly censorship heavy country</p>
    <p>I began to notice cracks in the simulation as soon as "My Stepsis is a Futanari" went away.</p>
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 0.46875em;">
      <img src="/blog/8-25/images/my_stepsis_is_a_futanari.jpg" height="100em" width="auto">
      <p style="margin: 0;text-indent: 0em; font-size: 0.8em;"></p>Society is a fickle thing -- first they ban your games, then your rights, and before you know it, its the fall of Rome all over again.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Now with crypto, no one can tell you what you can and cannot buy, <b>YOU</b> have control, <b>YOU</b> have privacy, <b>YOU</b> have freedom; the worlds your oyster right?</p>
    <h4>WRONG</h4>
    <p>Here's the thing about most coins: you <b>dont</b> control it, they <b>aren't</b> private, and they <b>are</b> centralized. Most crypto can be traced, if you aquired to by an exchange like Bicance or Kraken, chances are that your transactions are being monitored. Monero doesn't have such vulnerabilities. It uses one time stealth addresses, decoy signatures to hide the amount of money, where the money is going, and where is was recieved.</p>
    <p>It's so private, in fact that there is a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/09/14/irs-will-pay-up-to-625000-if-you-can-crack-monero-other-privacy-coins/">$625,000 bounty</a> put out by the IRS to help incentivize hackers finding ways to deanonymize its users (most of them being unliscenced pharmaceutical street vendors)</p>
    <h4>Why is Monero under attack?</h4>
    <p>The company <a href="https://qubic.org/">Qubic</a> recently developed their own in-house solution for mining Monero which is leagues above the competiton. Some sources even claim that they control 40% of all Monero being minted. Not only does this work against the idea of a decentalized form of currency, but it also opens itself up to the dreaded 51% attack.</p>
    <p>A 51% attack for those unaware is when a single party controls over 50% of all mining. This could be disasterous because it basically means that the checks and balances in place to keep blockchain manipulation, can be negated.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in helping keep Monero afloat, you can help mine in the <a href="https://www.supportxmr.com/">Support XMR</a> pool.</p>
    <p>wow, i spent like 3 hours researching and writing on this. i might take a few days off. i offically start college in a week and am currently packing things.</p>
