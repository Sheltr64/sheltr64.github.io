    <h3>I got a drawing tablet</h3>
    <p>Last week I expressed my desire to start drawing, I have a cool e-ink drawing tablet that served me pretty well but to be honest, it didn't fit my needs all too well. Most of what I do is done via my PC, and laptop, with a very small selection of devices thrown into the mix. The main issue is that it became a hassle to pick up and use on the daily, and exporting files was a major pain. Of course I could have used a <a href="https://nextcloud.com">Nextcloud</a> instance, but I have neither the time nor money to get a NAS working.</p>
    <p>For me, the obvoius choice was doing all the work on my desktop, so I ordered <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wacom-Wireless-Software-Pistachio-CTL4100WLE0/dp/B079J7DCXN?s=electronics">This</a> tablet by Wacom.</p>
    <p>Now that I'm offically Windows free, and switched to Linux, I have taken an oath to make anything and everything I do take 10x the time and effort because "iT'S mUh FrEEdoMs".</p>
    <p>Because of that, roadblocks appear in front of me every step of the way. One such roadblock was drivers, you see Wacom doesn't have any offical drivers for Linux, so instead, the community had to step in. I checked Github for any alternatives and found the <a href="https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/OpenTabletDriver">OpenTabletDriver</a> program and I have to say -- I'm thoughoughly impressed by how smooth and seemless the experience was. Truth be told I was expecting a old, clunky GTK2 program, but what I was met with was an easy to understand GUI that was a little bit on the underpowered side, but with plugins you could probably get by just fine!</p>
    <p>Do note that Linux <b>DOES</b> come with generic drawing tablet support out of the box, but for some reason playing OSU on it was all buggy. I did use an unoffical flatpak release of it, (no im not using your dumb appimg idgaf if its easier to maintain) and using the tablet had this issue where my cursor would be stuck in a corner, unable to move. I of course solved this issue by switching to OpenTabletDriver</p>
    <h3>As it stands, here is my current setup, and a little doodle I did on Krita.</h3>
